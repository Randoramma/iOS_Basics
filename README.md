#Notes

:black_large_square:  Atomic vs Non-Atomic 

__Atomic__
 * is the default behavior
 * will ensure the present process is completed by the CPU, before another process accesses the variable
 * is not fast, as it ensures the process is completed entirely
 * use where the instance variable is gonna be accessed in a multithreaded environment

__Non-Atomic__
 * is NOT the default behavior
 * faster (for synthesized code, that is, for variables created using @property and @synthesize)
 * not thread-safe
 * may result in unexpected behavior, when two different process access the same variable at the same time
 * use where the instance variable is not gonna be changed by multiple threads you can use it. It improves the performance



:black_large_square:  Copy vs Retain 

__Copy__
 * the object will be cloned with duplicate values. It is not shared with any one else.

__Retain__
 * the retain count increases by one. 
 * the instance of the object will be kept in memory until itâ€™s retain count drops to zero. 
 * The property will store a reference to this instance and will share the same instance with anyone else who retained it too.

__Assign__
 

__Strong__
  

__Weak__



:black_large_square:  Methods vs Functions 

__Methods__ -  are attached to class / instance (object) and you have to tell the class / object to perform them

```objective-c
// declaration
- (int)fooMethod {
    return 0;
}

// call
int a;
a = [someObjectOfThisClass fooMethod];
```

__Functions__ - are code blocks that are unrelated to an object / class

```objective-c
// declaration
int fooFunction() {
    return 0;
}

// call
int a;
a = fooFunction();
```

:black_large_square: Swizzling
 * allows the implementation of an existing selector to be switched at runtime for a different implementation in a classes dispatch table.
 * allows you to write code that can be executed before and/or after the original method.

```objective-c
#import "UIViewController+Log.h"
@implementation UIViewController (Log)
    + (void)load {
        static dispatch_once_t once_token;
        dispatch_once(&once_token,  ^{
            SEL viewWillAppearSelector = @selector(viewDidAppear:);
            SEL viewWillAppearLoggerSelector = @selector(log_viewDidAppear:);
            Method originalMethod = class_getInstanceMethod(self, viewWillAppearSelector);
            Method extendedMethod = class_getInstanceMethod(self, viewWillAppearLoggerSelector);
            method_exchangeImplementations(originalMethod, extendedMethod);
        });
    }
    - (void) log_viewDidAppear:(BOOL)animated {
        [self log_viewDidAppear:animated];
        NSLog(@"viewDidAppear executed for %@", [self class]);
    }
@end
```


:black_large_square:  Multi-Threading

__NSThread__ -  creates a new low-level thread which can be started by calling the start method.

```objective-c
NSThread* myThread = [[NSThread alloc] initWithTarget:self
                                        selector:@selector(myThreadMainMethod:)
                                        object:nil];
[myThread start];
```



__NSOperationQueue__ - allows a pool of threads to be created and used to execute NSOperations in parallel. NSOperations can also be run on the main thread by asking NSOperationQueue for the mainQueue.

```objective-c
NSOperationQueue* myQueue = [[NSOperationQueue alloc] init];
[myQueue addOperation:anOperation]; 
[myQueue addOperationWithBlock:^{
   /* Do something. */
}];
```

__GCD or Grand Central Dispatch__ - is a modern feature of Objective-C that provides a rich set of methods and API's to use in order to support common multi-threading tasks. GCD provides a way to queue tasks for dispatch on either the main thread, a concurrent queue (tasks are run in parallel) or a serial queue (tasks are run in FIFO order).

```objective-c
dispatch_queue_t myQueue = dispatch_get_global_queue(DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_DEFAULT, 0);
dispatch_async(myQueue, ^{
    printf("Do some work here.\n");
});
```
